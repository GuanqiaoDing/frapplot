Description: This package aims to automatically process Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) data and generate consistent, publishable figures. The automation would bring down the hour-long routine work to a few seconds for researchers that often do FRAP experiments. Note: this package does not replace ImageJ (or its equivalance) in raw image quantification.
